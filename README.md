# VGA Text Mode
This repository pertains to the incorporation of VGA text mode in our kernel. Here weâ€™ll create an interface through which we can use its functionality to print something on a screen. 
To create that interface we need to follow certain steps:



## Steps to create a bare-metal executable:
* Create Rust module and define colors
* Provide color code
* Provide text buffer
* Create Writer
* Adding implementation to the Writer

To understand the logic behind this template. Please have a look at the blog series *OS in Rust*:
